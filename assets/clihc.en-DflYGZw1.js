  <h1>History of <strong>CLIHC</strong></h1>

  <p class="lead text-muted mb-5">
    Since its inaugural edition in 2003 in Rio de Janeiro, the Latin American Conference on Human–Computer
    Interaction (<em>CLIHC</em>) has established itself as the biennial benchmark forum in Latin America for
    researchers, professionals, and students in the field of human–computer interaction. Each edition tackles
    emerging challenges—such as accessibility, inclusive design, and ubiquitous technologies—and strengthens
    the regional community through keynotes, workshops, presentations, and academic exchange.

          From <strong>October 30 to November 1, 2023</strong>, the city of <strong>Puebla, Mexico</strong>, hosted the
          <strong>eleventh edition</strong> of the <em>Latin American Conference on Human–Computer Interaction
            (CLIHC)</em>.
          This edition marked a vibrant return to in-person meetings, effectively combining on-site activities with
          online
          broadcasts in a <strong>hybrid format</strong> that encouraged both regional and international participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Call for Papers</em> was conducted through the <a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/clihc2023"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EasyChair</strong></a> platform, inviting submissions in the
          categories
          of <strong>full papers</strong>, <strong>short papers</strong>, and <strong>posters</strong>. The process
          began
          with abstract registration on <strong>June 12</strong> and concluded on <strong>June 19, 2023</strong>,
          resulting
          in a diverse and high-quality call.

          From <strong>November 22 to 23, 2021</strong>, the tenth edition of the Latin American Conference on
          Human–Computer Interaction (CLIHC) took place, organized from <strong>Valparaíso, Chile</strong>. Due to the
          global COVID-19 situation, this edition was held <strong>entirely online</strong>, which posed an
          organizational challenge and, at the same time, provided an opportunity to expand participation from various
          regions of Latin America and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general organization was led by <em>General Chairs</em> <strong>Yazmín Magallanes</strong> (Universidad de
          las Américas Puebla, Mexico), <strong>Claudia López</strong> (Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María,
          Chile), and <strong>Laura S. Gaytán Lugo</strong> (Universidad de Colima, Mexico), who coordinated the
          academic and logistical efforts of this virtual edition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Call for Papers</em> was managed via the EasyChair platform, accepting <strong>full papers</strong>
          and <strong>short papers</strong>. Key dates included the abstract submission deadline on <strong>June
            30</strong> and the final manuscript deadline on <strong>July 8, 2021</strong>. All submissions were
          evaluated through a <strong>double-blind review</strong> process to ensure academic quality and thematic
          diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The academic program of CLIHC 2021 included <strong>keynote lectures</strong> from international experts,
          <strong>technical presentations</strong> of accepted papers, and <strong>discussion panels</strong> on
          relevant topics such as digital inclusion, accessible technologies, and user-centered design. Despite being
          virtual, the event fostered a collaborative environment through synchronous sessions and spaces for sharing
          ideas and experiences.
